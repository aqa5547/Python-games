Description

This is a simple game built using Python and the pygame library. The player controls a basket that moves left and right to catch falling apples. Each successful catch increases the score, and if the apple falls off the screen, a new one appears.

pip install pygame

How to Play

Use the left arrow key (←) to move the basket left.

Use the right arrow key (→) to move the basket right.

Catch the falling apples to increase your score.

The game continues indefinitely until you close the window.

Running the Game

To run the game, execute the Python script:

python simple_game.py

Features

Smooth movement using pygame.key.get_pressed().

Randomly generated apple positions.

Score tracking and display.

Future Improvements

Add sound effects.

Introduce different levels of difficulty.

Implement a game-over screen.
